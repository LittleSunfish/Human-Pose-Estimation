## 3. Explanation about this Repo
This repository is for mainly for re-implementaion of HRNet.
### 3.1 model
In the folder model, HRNet is implemented in the file HRNet_HPE.py
For comparision of the HRNet to ResNet, there is also ResNet50_HPE.py in the same folder 
### 3.2 tools
I implmented some tools related to the human pose estimation.
customCOCO.py contains implementaion of the dataloader for the COCO dataset.
visualization.py contains a way to visualize the keypoint detection.
### 3.3 jupyter
You can ignore this folder. I work with notebook file and then move onto the script.
